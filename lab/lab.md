Here I attempt to document my homelab and technical projects and pursuits.
I will hyperlink things to keep this page minimal. There may be some overlap from here to my Life page and subpages, which is why I am going to hyperlink as much as possible, so I can have a somewhat professional and usable wiki-style structure. 
Until I move over everything from my self-hosted wiki, I'll just be putting some thoughts on here that weren't good enough to turn into articles.
