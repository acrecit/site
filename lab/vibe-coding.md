title: Vibe Coding
---
One reason I donâ€™t vibe code is because the one time I tried, it filled me with anxiety and left me completely unsatisfied. 
Struggling through docs and hours of broken code on your own, then finally making something work through pure will is infinitely more rewarding.
It's real learning.

Learn to do things yourself. 

Vibe coding is not inherently evil, rather, it is a symptom of an epidemic of laziness. 

Do hard things.
