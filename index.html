		<p>This is a much simplified version of my previous site where I mainly uploaded blogposts and book reviews. This website is coded purely statically in HTML and CSS as opposed to the slop JS I was using before. I'll be adding a lot to this site in the coming months, as well as migrating the content from my old website over to here.</p>
